# muOS Epic Noir skin

This is mainly a port of the Epic Noir theme, [originally by c64-dev & Chicuelo](https://github.com/c64-dev/es-theme-epicnoir).

All images are fully recreated to fit muOS and it contains a nice suitable home screen.\
Epic White is a brand new version of Noir with brighter colours.

Installation steps below.
